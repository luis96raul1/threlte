# RF JSON Definition Generator
This library is designed to simplify the process of maintaining JSON for RF branding definitions. It allows you to generate your JSON files on the fly, rather than manually maintaining them.

## Usage

To use the library, follow these steps:

1. In your JavaScript file, create an array of all definition files you want to create. The library will create one file per item in the array. Here is an example:

```js
const FILES_TO_GENERATE = [
  {
    name: 'test',
    groups: []
  }
]
```
2. For each definition, you can create an array of "Groups". Each group is made up of a "title" and an array of "fields." Each group is an accordion in the output. If you don't have multiple groups, you can pass an array of fields into "groups" instead. Here is how you can define groups:

```js
const groups = [
  {
    title: 'Accordion Title',
    fields: []
  }
]
```
3. Create an array of "fields" where each field is a tuple:

```js
const field = ['Label', 'Keyword', 'Tooltip', {...allOtherFields}] 
```
4. The goal is to create all your fields quickly like so:

```js
const fields = [
  ['Primary Color'], // converts label to camelCase automatically for keyword ([%primaryColor%])
  ['On Primary Color', 'customKeyword'] //  uses "customKeyword" for manual keyword
] 
```
5. Import `generateDefinitions()` function from `generate-definition-json`.
6. Use the function in your document.

## Example

Here is an example of how you can use the library:

```js
import { generateDefinitions } from '@eborall/generate-definition-json'

const fields = [
  ['Primary Color'], 
  ['On Primary Color', 'customKeyword']
]

const groups = [
  {
    title: 'Accordion Title',
    fields: fields
  }
]

const FILES_TO_GENERATE = [
  {
    name: 'test',
    groups: groups
  }
]

generateDefinitions(FILES_TO_GENERATE)
```

## Running the script

After you have created the JavaScript file and defined your groups and fields, you can run the file via package.json using the command `node fileName.js`. This will generate a bunch of `.json` files based on whatever your filename was.
